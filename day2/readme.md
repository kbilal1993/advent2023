# Day 2:

# Scenario
There's a bag of coloured cubes. You are shown a random subset of these cubes in 3 different sets.
You are given a list of potential games. You need to test which ones would be possible with a given set of cubes.

Each game entry looks like this:
game n: <game>; <game>; <game>

Each <game> looks like this:
3 blue, 4 red, 1 green


You only have 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes and 14 blue cubes. Find all games that are possible given the input and add up the IDs.
